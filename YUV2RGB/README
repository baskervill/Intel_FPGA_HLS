This design example implements a basic YUV422 to RGB888 colour space conversion.

The component in this example reads a single YUV422 word (representing two YUV
pixels) and emits two RGB888 words (representing two RGB pixels).

The testbench reads image_in.bmp (an RGB encoded bitmap), converts the data to
YUV422 format, then passes the YUV422 data to the component to convert back to
RGB format.  The resulting RGB image (which has undergone two colour space
transformations: RGB888 -> YUV422 -> RGB888) is emitted to image_out.bmp.  For
the sample image provided, the output can be compared to image_out.bmp.golden
to verify correctness.
