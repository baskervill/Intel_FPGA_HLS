This design example demonstrates the usage of ac_fixed constructor where
higher QoR can be achieved using minor variations in coding style:

By converting dynamic double/float value outside of component code 
will show significant QoR gain in area.

You can view QoR result in tutorial-fpga.prj/reports/report.html.
