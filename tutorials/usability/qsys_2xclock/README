This tutorial contains a very simple component which produces an interface with
a clock and clock2x signal. This can occur when the memory architecture produced
by the compiler has double-pumped memory. These are M20K blocks which operate at
twice the frequency of the logic and effectively act as if they have twice the
number of ports.

This tutorial demonstrates how to take the generated component and incorporate
it in a Qsys system with a PLL which can produce the clock and the clock2x
signals for the component. After running the tutorial, open the Qsys system and
observe the PLL settings. The PLL takes in a reference clock and produces two
output clock signals. Note that one clock is set to generate twice the frequency
of the other and that the two clocks are generated in phase with each other. 

The system also contains a reset synchronizer block which provides the reset to
the component. The purpose of the synchronizer block is to ensure that the
de-assertion of the reset is synchronized to the positive edge of the clock.
Observe the way which the clock and reset signals are connected to the component
from the PLL and the synchronizer block in the "System Contents" view.

This tutorial requires the following tools to be installed:
  - i++
  - Qsys

To run this tutorial:
  - Run make (on Linux) 
  - Run build (on Windows). 

This will generate the Qsys system top.qsys but will not generate the HDL
associated with it. Once generated, the Qsys system can be viewed with the
following command:
  - qsys-edit top.qsys
The top.qsys file can also be used to generate the Qsys system or to compile in
a Quartus project.
