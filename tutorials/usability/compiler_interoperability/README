Compilation of the accelerated component has to be performed with our the HLS compiler.
Files that only contain testbench code can be compiled and linked by any compiler. 

The HLS compiler is compatible with x86-64 object code compiled by other compilers.
The testbench part can be compiled with the native compiler for the platform. That is, 
gcc/g++ on Linux and the Microsoft C Compiler on Windows (see documentation for
which compiler versions are supported).

The accelerated component functions and the final link step should be performed with the HLS compiler.

This tutorial requires the following tools to be installed:
  - i++
  - ModelSim

To run this tutorial on Linux:
  - On Linux run "make"
  - On Windows run "build"
