This design demonstrates use of multiple stream call sites.

All call sites accessing the same stream share one FIFO port. Regions that contain
multiple reads or writes to the same stream are serialized. That is, the hardware
corresponding to that region executes only a single thread or loop iteration at a
time. This serializing approach ensures that the ordering of the reads and writes is
equivalent when the component runs either as an x86 emulation or on the FPGA
simulation.

To view multiple stream call sites in high-level design report:
1. Open the high-level design report by opening the following file in web browser:
tutorial-fpga.prj/reports/report.html
2. Click "View Reports" and select "Component viewer".
3. In the Component list pane, select "reduce_sum".
4. In the Component view pane, find the two stream read sites from stream
"int_in".
